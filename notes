send button: _30yy _38lh _39bl
like button: _4rv9 _30yy _39bl

react node ids change peruser, cannot use these

workflow

register:
- generate key pair on machine
- send public through chat bot
- chat bot uploads userid, public key as a key value
    - need to ensure request is coming from chat bot somehow

usage:
- provide local path to private key
- On message send, if using encryption, intercept message
    - Add on enter pressed BEFORE react calls
- encrypt with private key
- send ciphertext instead
    - simply replace the text before the call ends, should fallthrough to react call to send message

two ways to decrypt
easier:
- have button to decrypt all messages
harder:
- on a new message (how to do this?) decrypt

challenges:
- get userid (not too hard)
- nicely hooking into react to get control of enter button
    - previously used alt, can we fix this?
