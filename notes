send button: _30yy _38lh _39bl
like button: _4rv9 _30yy _39bl

react node ids change peruser, cannot use these

workflow

register:
- generate key pair on machine
- send public through chat bot
- chat bot uploads userid, public key as a key value
    - need to ensure request is coming from chat bot somehow

usage:
- provide local path to private key
- On message send, if using encryption, intercept message
- encrypt with public key
- send ciphertext instead
    - simply replace the text before the call ends, should fallthrough to react call to send message

- when messenger is opened, if lock is enabled we do start up stuff
- when lock is switched on, we also do start up stuff
- when lock is disabled, refresh page (?)

start up stuff
- inject code to catch messages and encrypt (see below)
    - includes openPGP code
- decrypt any messages on screen

injection code
- hook into enter button to catch messages before sending (DONE)
- grab user fbid and chatter fbid (IGNORE GROUPS)
    - async call to fetch public key
    - Regrab on new message select


two ways to decrypt
easier:
- have button to decrypt all messages
harder:
- on a new message (how to do this?) decrypt

challenges:
- get userid (not too hard)
- nicely hooking into react to get control of enter button
    - previously used alt, can we fix this?
